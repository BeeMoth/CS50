# CS50
Dated CS50 projects I started off learning with.

Not much important or impressive to see here. Just me stumbling about, learning the early bits of programming from a solid resouce.
Though there were plenty of times where I wish I had someone to help me with one or two small details.

Bits and pieces aren't my own, all of which are at least loosely documented within each project.
